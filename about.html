<h2>About The Singular Project</h2>
<p>Singular was initially created by William Lahti to explore the performance and feasibility of two-way data binding in HTML5 applications. Angular's 
	documentation was very poor (they have since fixed that) and Angular's design itself seemed too complex and unwieldy for many people to be able to 
	intuitively use. Singular was crafted in such a way that it would be easy to sprinkle just a little bit of Singular on whatever large project you 
	happen to be working on, so that transitioning complex applications can be done gradually.</p>
